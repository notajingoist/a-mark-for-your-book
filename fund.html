		<h1>A fund for stamps &amp; envelopes.</h1>
		<p><span class="highlight caps">What is this?</span></p>
		<p>
			So, even though I'm offering my services for free, it turns out that stamps and envelopes (and paper and paint but whatever) actually cost money. I don't mind buying them myself, though it would be nice if generous people chipped in once in a while. I'm looking at small amounts, like 3 cents (my favorite number) or 47 cents (my lucky number).

		<p>
			To all you kind souls, thank you in advance.

			If you actually know me in real life, you can just give me physical stamps and envelopes or cash (coins). Or you may pay me through <a href="https://venmo.com">Venmo</a>, but I've literally used it only twice in my life so you'll have to find me on there somehow and figure it out.

			Otherwise, if you are a random stranger on the internet, just <a href="mailto:notajingoist@gmail.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20help%20fund%20you!">email me</a> and maybe I can figure out how PayPal works or something. (Do strangers pay each other using Venmo? Is that a thing that people do?). Actually, it might just be easier if you didn't help fund me at all. Thanks.
